# Spotify Playlist Creator

This Spotify web app was created as a project on Codecademy's Web Development Course, from scratch and can be accessed via: https://shaqs-spotify-web-app.surge.sh

## Project

This project was created via React, and accesses data from the Spotify API to allow users to log in, search songs by Song, Album or Artist and add these to a custom named playlist, before saving to their personal Spotify accounts.

## Future Adjustments

In future, I will be adding additional features to this projects, as well as redesigning that CSS, which was the provided to me for speed purposes.
