This Spotify web app was created as a project on Codecademy's Web Development Course, from scratch and can be accessed via: https://shaqs-spotify-web-app.surge.sh

This project was created via React, and accesses data from the Spotify API to allow users to log in, search songs by Song, Album or Artist and add these to a custom named playlist, before saving to their personal Spotify accounts.

In future, I will be adding additional features to this projects, as well as redesigning that CSS, which was the provided to me for speed purposes.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open http://shaqs-spotify-web-app.surge.sh to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
